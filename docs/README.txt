The Contact Manager Application
===============================

Introduction
------------
Hold your breath, this is carries memories as one of the few applications that I had to develop as part of the technical job interview - Demonstration of Skills they say (Talk is cheap apparently). 
The mini Contact Manager was developed in fulfilment of the then potential employer requirements at the time of the interview. This forms part of many small to large scale applications that I had to develop as a proof of concept and skills to a number of compenies (petential employers and clients). The longest was a proof of concept on an Online Company Registration System with integration to a number of legacy backend systems (Unfortunately, the code base wont be shared here, and for obvious reasons).
The Contact manager application was/is built on top of the ZF1 MVC layer on a single module architecture.

Kindly note, Zend Framework has evolved ever since, from ZF1, ZF2, ZF3 and now [Laminas](https://getlaminas.org "Laminas's Homepage"). 

Zend Framework was provided by [Zend Technologies.](https://framework.zend.com/ "Zend Framework's Homepage")

The future
-----------
I am not yet sure of the direction to take this, currently I have embarked on a journey with more modern , challenging and exciting technologies that offer more potential for building futuristic distributed mult-platforms applicatios.

Or, perhaps this code base will not evolve futher, perhaps I will just keeping it they way it is as reminder to once humble beginings, chances taken and opportunities given, sitting in a beautifull office, surrounded by beutiful souls with a cup of coffee next to me just doing what coders do - prove their worhthy ! This is a reminder to me of the beautiful interview sessions that I have ever sat in.
